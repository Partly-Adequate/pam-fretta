PAM Fretta
===
PAM Fretta is a PAM extension that utilizes the UI from gmod-mapvote. It requires PAM to work and doesn't offer any of the original features. It's just the ui.

[Tyrantelf's version of gmod-mapvote](https://github.com/tyrantelf/gmod-mapvote) is based on [Willox's](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Willox303) Mapvoting system.
You can read more about it in [the original facepunch thread](https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1268353).
